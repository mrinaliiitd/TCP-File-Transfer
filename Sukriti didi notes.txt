clustered dataset, feeling bias in it
clustered into 4539 families
analysis done on these families


Conserved domain Pfam - did not found many 

eg. ribosomal proteins have a specific domain


no good homologous templace
=> FOld recognition or abinitio

Why structure analysis for function?
eg. beta barrel -> transport (but should also be in membrane na)


Housekeeping proteins (conserved throughout)
protein to be secreted for
1. Cell cell communication
2. antimicrobial peptide
also divideed in
Horizontal gene transfer 

Heatshock proteins(Check if divided in this)

Checked if secreted or transmembrane

run it through metagenomes of just gut
in mouth, vagina -> 

would be localised in cytoplasm, no DNA in bacteria
DNA Binding domain?
Localised in cytoplasm


eg. transportable proteins -> 6-10 helices

4 locations taken:
mouth, gut(6.7-8.5pH), skin, vagina(3.8-4.5pH)

DNA sequences also given
first dna sequences -> Open Reading frames -> CHecked which will be transcribed/transcripted
RNACode
Transcription factors, cytoplasm localised

RiboSeq - translated/transcribed

Bacterial and eukaryotic genomes
intronix sequences in eukaryotic

genes working similar functions are clubbed together in bacterial 
bacterial operon
defined bacteriophages, crispr genes for them which lie together
virulent proteins

eg. lactose operon

One way:
	Start with Grouping localisation
	then eg. channel proteins

Second way: 
	Placed where extracted from (Gut, mouth, vagina, skin)

Make cluster in short and long proteins on the basis of localisation or something, then multiple sequence align long and short proteins of one cluster to check for similar function
If long ke domains me align to we can say similar, or better, specific function of the short protein  
micro modulator


check what is antimicrobial peptide
